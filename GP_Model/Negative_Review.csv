"""CLEAR CLEAN ESN"" Sprint EPIC 4G Galaxy SPH-D700*FRONT CAMERA*ANDROID*SLIDER*QWERTY KEYBOARD*TOUCH SCREEN",Samsung,I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.,negative

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,"Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste.",negative

"""Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FM Radio, SNS Integration, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - White International Version/Warranty",Nokia,"I've been a long time user of the iPhone. I finally got sick of it and sold it. I just wanted a simple phone. After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well. The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.",negative

"[XMAS DEAL] [New Edition] Jethro [SC213V2] Flip Quad-band Unlocked GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Emergency Button, 2.4"" Large LCD with Large Keypad.",Jethro,"I am a computer programmer, but I have to admit that I never made the transition to smartphone, mainly because I sit in from of a computer everyday anyway. If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that's problem is solved. No it wasn't. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn't see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn't work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don't have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven't used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it. Plus it is inexpensive, so if you break or lose it, then ""No Biggie"".",negative

So expect reception to get worse over time.* The time/date was not set automatically. Seriously? What year is this?* Unlike every other phone, the buttons directly under the screen are not actually the navigation buttons, they are M1 and M2 which are speed dials. Probably not a problem if this is someone's first phone, but it drove me nuts.* no FCC id! This phone might be illegal to use in the US.* Poor manufacturing quality - the battery is hard to insert and remove because the battery is slightly too big for the part where it's supposed to fit* The voice mail number has to be programmed. Similar to the time/date, every other phone I've ever had picked this setting up from the network automatically.* As other reviews have mentioned, the hangup button, if pressed for longer than about 1 second, the phone powers off.

I like the big buttons and the charging cradle. The phone feels cheap. I was afraid I'd break the plastic pieces pulling off the cover to get to the battery and SIM card. We I nstalled 3 different SIM cards from Cricket Wireless (AT&T network) at their store and could not get it connected. Don't know for sure if it's something broken on the phone or just an incompatibility. Other reviewers saying they have connected on AT&T leads me to think something is wrong with the phone.

"[XMAS DEAL] Jethro [SC118] Simple Unlocked Quad-band GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Button, Easy to Use, Light Weight, Large Keyboard [New Firmware Edition]",Jethro,"This phone is very difficult to unlock. To unlock the phone, you need to press the unlock key 3 times. The first press wakes up the phone, the second press results in a message which says to press the unlock key to unlock. The third press unlocks the phone. There isn't any easier method for unlocking the keyboard without disabling the lock altogether.If you are buying this phone for someone elderly with technology ""issues"" (as we did), they may have a lot of difficulty using this phone. If the three unlock presses aren't done quick enough, the unlock sequence has to be started again. If the unlock key is pressed 4 times, the phone will be locked again instead of being unlocked. All of this is very difficult to explain to someone with dexterity and technology issues.I have never heard of a phone that is this difficult to unlock. It's hard to believe that there isn't an easier method to unlock the phone. However, I have called customer support and they confirmed that the phone does take 3 unlock presses to unlock the phone. The only alternative is to disable the lock feature.On the plus side, the SOS key does work very well and doesn't require one to unlock the keys. The SOS key can be programmed to send text messages and call 911.Another thing to note is that the title for this phone indicates that there is an extra 20% off today. However, they raised the price by about 10% yesterday to $39.99. So, you aren't saving 20%. I hate when companies raise a price just so they can tell you that you are going to save ""more"". I paid the $29.99 ""black friday"" price which was lower than the normal price.",negative

With it for a couple of hours.... I continued to use it with a busted screen BC I couldn't afford. Repairs and finally about six months. After my purchases it finally knocked. Off and died too....and what little time it did work it would constantly go dead took hours to charge would die within3 mins and never had a bit of working.

I don't really know if I hit the screen too hard (which I don't think so) or the material is way too bad. I was pretty excited about this smartphone since it reminded me of my now old Moto G. I don't recommend buying this phone.",negative

I sent the phone back it arrived at their return location about a week ago. I ve tried contactig them numerous times through email and phone to try and find out information abiut my device.

The phone had good performance and audio but there were often horrible slowdowns when typing (say for a google search or text) where I would have to wait for 30 seconds while the phone would catch up, sometimes the thing would just outright crash trying to catch up. Guess this phone is suffering from a memory leak or just can't handle typing...Another unfortunate issue is the availability of decent phone cases.

I purchased two of these phones (The first in June 2015 from Amazon and the second one in Sep 2015 directly from Alcatel who used Amazon to fulfill the order). My Primary reason for the purchases was support for T-Mobile Band 12 and the price point. Well, for the last couple of months, the signal quality has been noticeably worse,...missing calls, texts etc. I tried to think back to what changed and I remembered an OTA update in Janurary from Alcatel. After some research, I discovered that Alcatel's Janurary OTA firmware update REMOVED support for T-Mobile band 12! They actually took away the feature that was my primary reason for purchase. No warnings, no communications. It was done secretly and now I have two phones that perform very poorly. When I contacted them their response was basically ""Screw you...too bad."" I have read they have no plans to update it and make it work. It's bringing your new car to the dealer for an oil change and them removing your transmission without telling you leaving you with a useless hunk of metal. Shame on you Alcatel/TCL and Amazon!

Also I was expecting a lot from the dual speakers and have been very disappointed in the sound and loudness of them. The camera is pretty dreadful, just terrible pictures and the video recorder is awful in terms of functionality. I think I'll go back to Asus when I can justify buying a new phone.

Bottom line if I could of tried it out for a day before purchasing it would I still have bought it? I can honestly say no I wouldn't have purchased it. Is this phone a flagship killer?

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"Update 1: I bought my first Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 in June 2015. 6 months later it wouldn't stop shutting down. I sent it in for repair. However, they did not repair it when I got it back. I am not sure the repairman knew what he was doing. Oddly, the repairman shipped it himself to me too.Update 2: Upon writing to Alcatel through Facebook Messenger, they sent me a brand new phone. Had they not done something to make me satisfied, I would have given a scathing review of this phone. $250 might not seem like a lot, but to me it is. And I would have had to buy a new phone with a budget of probably only $50-$100. Alcatel seems like a good company. Though, they now were just bought out by Nokia.Pros:1. Price: I have had looks at my family member's Apple iPhone's and Samsung Galaxy's and they didn't seem much better than this phone in terms of speed or interface. My father's Samsung Galaxy 5 had a similar problem to mine after 1.5 years of owning it. A phone should last longer than two years in my opinion. However, even if I only get a year out of this phone, it is still a better deal than buying an iPhone or Galaxy because they are around $700-$800. So, I would only be spending $500 for two years. But then, you're in Nexus territory and that's probably a better-made phone.2. Camera: It seems really sharp to me. The ability to take HDR videos is a real plus, but the videos take up about 100 MB per minute.3. Charger: The charger is really fast. It charges in about 1-2 hours. The battery lasts for about a day if you use it a lot. If you put it on Airplane mode as I do at night, the battery goes down maybe 1-2%, which is great.4. Headphones: It comes with a pretty good set of ear-buds. They are much better quality than say a Sony pair for $20 or from the classic Apple iPods from the mid-to-late 2000's. Though, I can't say I really use them ever, because I have a good over-the-ear headphone set and a clip-on $15 one for exercising.5. Large Screen: Everyone that has seen the phone was impressed with its screen size and resolution.Cons:1. Android: I believe sometime after getting this phone, Android made it so that apps could only be stored on an SD card. I haven't completely used the 16 GB (which is really around 11 GB) in downloading apps.2. Text Messaging App: This for some reason doesn't have a ""new line"" button. You either have to send multiple text messages or you have to use the voice-to-text feature and say ""New Line."" All the other apps have a ""new line"" button that appears. It's a really odd gap to leave this out.3. Laggy after Booting or after Prolonged Non-Use: I didn't have this problem in other phones.which were only around $80. But upon rebooting the phone, I have type in my password. However, the keyboard lags in appearing or might not at all if you don't wait long enough for the phone to get its bearings OR the keyboard will appear and it you just won't be able to type on it. This probably happens the majority of the time.This also happens if the phone hasn't been in use for awhile like when I have it in airplane mode at night and then turn it off. This happens probably 1/3 of the time.4. Memo App: Its built-in memo app doesn't have an email function or an option to copy them to an SD card.5. Calendar-to-Map: I put in my addresses for places I need to go to for my appointments. However, if the notification for the even comes up and I click the address, it will open up Google Maps through Chrome instead of just through Maps. It's an extra step that is sort of annoying especially when driving. So, I have to make sure I am ready to go before driving basically.6. Smart Lock: Its trusted places function requires me to have do the same place multiple times if I go to a different level in my house or even a different room.Despite what other reviewers have been saying on here about Alcatel being a horrible company when it comes to customer service, I have found this not to be true so far.

I have had the phone for about 4 months now, and it has been inside a case. The power button has stopped functioning correctly. I can still feel mechanical action of the button functioning correctly, but the button is not working electrically possibly due to a broken solder joint. I say this because I get occasional functionality if I press the button to the point that it feels like it will break the phone, and when this works the screen may flash on and off three times as if it was electrically connected three times.Alcatel's support / warranty requires the owner to pay for shipping to and from their facility, leaving the owner without a phone for the duration of shipping+repairs.

Super thin and light. Stereo front facing speakers with amazing sound quality. Full HD screen both bright and crisp. Nearly pure version of Android Lollipop. Respectable battery life. JBL headset IN THE BOX. Attractive looks that are just enough different from the crowd for people to ask, ""hey, what kind of phone is THAT?""Sounds great, right? The problem for me is two-fold. 1) There are only 11 GB of available storage on the phone, which is really, really small. Well, you say, that shouldn't be a problem because it supports Micro SD cards up to 128GB, right? 2) Yes, it does support Micro SD cards but the implementation is almost unusable.You cannot move apps from the phone to the SD card, really. Oh, you have the option in Application Manager to ""Move to SD Card"" but because of the way they've made the filesystem, you only have the ILLUSION of the app actually moving. Move an APP and then go look at the SD Card in File Manager, and you find that NOTHING actually moved.Further, some apps (like Amazon Music) which allow for selecting where files should go, only recognize the SD card SOME of the time. Other times, nada. Also, sometime the SD card wouldn't mount, leaving lots of missed apps and files (even though the apps aren't actually ON the SD Card).Last complaint: Wifi reception and speeds were sketchy compared to all the other devices in my house.In the end, I sent this phone back and bought a used Note 4.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"I really, really wanted to like this phone. The screen is just fantastic and the speakers are amazing. It absolutely blows away my Moto X 2014 in that regard. The processor is OK, there's a bit of lag here and there but it's not overwhelming and something you can easily live with. The battery life seemed to be really fantastic, and it was a mostly great device.I only ran into problems when it comes to using it as a phone. Calls sound muddy, and everyone who I spoke to had issues understanding me. Coming from my Moto X, which had fantastic call quality, this was very disappointing. Using the phone in speakerphone mode didn't help at all, if anything, it made it worse! I've also noticed it struggled with signal strength in the same areas where the X had no issue, consistently pulling a signal that was anywhere between 5-7 dBm worse than the X.Maybe I got a bad device, but in reading more reviews I've noticed that muffled calls and signal issues seem to be commonplace. Honestly, a slightly better microphone and antenna would make this a killer phone. If your goal is to use the browser and apps, you'll be fine with this phone. If you plan on anything more than occasional call, I'd look for something else.",negative
"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"I have never been as disappointed with an item from Amazon as I am with this one.First, some good points about the phone. The display and audio are top notch. Not even by grading on the curve of a $250 phone, they were as good or better than just about any flagship I've had. As good or better than any other display I've seen, and the front facing stereo speakers were amazing. No question about it. The phone performed fairly well, just a little bit slower than my 2013 LG Optimus G Pro, which had the same basic specs as this unit. The almost stock Android Lollipop was a nice thing to have, not much bloatware had to be removed. I changed the phone's supplied launcher to the Google Launcher and that gave the unit even more of a stock Android feel.I should have known I was in for a nightmare when I opened the phone and found that Alcatel didn't include the tool that's needed to pop out the SIM and SD card tray. It took a couple of hours to find something small enough to fit into the tiny hole that releases the tray, and since the phone arrived on a Saturday, Alcatel tech support was closed and Amazon was no help, offering to send a replacement phone that might arrive Monday, but most likely would come Tuesday. Glad I pay for Amazon Prime to get such speedy service when a product is defective. But I finally got the tray open and was able to insert the SIM and SD cards from my current phone. Turned the phone on and it immediately found AT&T, provisioned itself smoothly, and I thought I was off to the races. Boy, was I wrong.I spent almost two days migrating apps from my old phone to this one, arranging the icons on the screen where I wanted them (this phone only allowed 4 icons in a row while the LG had 5, so the NFC setup process couldn't replicate my current screen arrangement) and re-entering login and other information for all my apps. I have a fair amount of apps, so it took a while. In order to clean the cache and speed up the phone a bit after everything was ""just so"", I restarted the phone, something I've done with the ten or so other Android phones I've had over the years. When the phone came back up, I noticed that about a third of the app icons were gone from my home screens. Just gone. And when I tried to open a couple of other apps, I got a message on the bottom of the screen that the app wasn't installed.I know Android can do some funky things, so I waited about ten minutes to see if the information would show up on the screen and it hadn't changed, so I rebooted the phone again. When it came on, even MORE icons were missing from the home screens. I could find most (not all) of the missing apps in the app drawer and could launch about half of them. But some of the data was gone, with very little chance of getting it back. And since I lost more data the second time I restarted the phone, I wasn't really interested in restarting again and losing even more data.So the two days I spent getting the phone loaded up were blown the second I tried to restart it. I hardly call that a small bug, and looking around some developer forums, it doesn't seem to be a bug tied to Android 5.0.2, which is what the phone is running with an Alcatel layer over it. So it's either the Alcatel modifications or a hardware issue causing the problem. Either way, that kind of performance is completely unacceptable, and while I think the phone has some good parts to it and the price is right, if it's going to lose data, I can't trust it or continue to use it. Even my kid's $99 BLU phone is more stable than this device is.So back to Amazon it goes, along with the accessories that were supposed to arrive on Sunday but didn't come because Amazon made a deal with the Devil when they chose the USPS to handle its Sunday deliveries. All in all, about a $300 lesson that sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case I got a useless, low quality phone on the inside that looks like a great phone on the outside.Oh, and one more thing. Amazon chose to ship the phone via USPS in a padded envelope, not a box. I found the envelope with the phone in it jammed in my mailbox with all my other mail, making for a very tight squeeze to get the envelope out of the mailbox without tearing it. So the phone had less protection than it probably should have had and went through the postal system, which could have led to some kind of a hardware defect. I'm not going to try my luck with another phone, especially if Amazon is going to use such an insecure way to ship the phone. I bet they don't ship S6's in envelopes. Just sayin'.Next time, I'll spend a little more money and get a phone I can trust.",negative

I looked up the specs, read the reviews and searched online for the best phone for my money. I decided this was the phone to get, everyone raved about it. They said it was the best phone under $300, blah blah you've probably seen all that too. Lets start with the good. It has a pretty decent camera and a nice big screen... that's about it. I consider myself to be a simple man, if I buy something, its because it's supposed to serve a purpose. This phone froze all of the time, not only did I experience the stutter others experienced, but it froze and it crashed often. At first I thought it was my fault, so I cleared all of my cache, deleted useless folders, downloaded cleaner apps etc. but nothing worked, the phone kept freezing, crashing, and rebooting itself when I was in the middle of things. I've had this phone about two weeks now and I've had it. In a rage, I twisted the phone in my hands until I had shattered the LCD, screen and mangled the housing. It felt awesome. All in all, I should have known better this phone was released in 2014 and we're living in 2016. Two years in the tech industry is a lifetime... don't make the mistake I made.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are.",negative

The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone.

(that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this.

A vivid, bright screen, decent speakers and low price can't make up for basic functionality I rely on everyday. I'll mess around with it some more but will likely return if I can't get these features to work. I'm coming from a Google/LG Nexus 4 that took a bath in a lake and I'm missing that phone already. I do find the Idol 3 to have more lag than my Nexus 4, which was running KitKat, not Lollipop.Update: Turned out that the Bluetooth pairing problem was on the Sync end. Following a master reset of Sync the phone paired effortlessly for both phone and media audio. Haven't tried text to speech yet though.

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"I purchased this phone only recently here on Amazon and paid $99 - but it is now listed @ $240. And so you might think I would be delighted that I got such a 'good' deal, right? WRONG. I am extremely disappointed with this phone, despite my previous research and finding many good reviews on it.I have an LG41C with no special bells and whistles, though it pretty much has everything I really need. But after almost two years, it's got a couple of glitches that can't be resolved so I thought I would ""upgrade"" to another brand and a larger size. What a mistake!This Alcatel takes 45 + seconds to start fully (my LG takes 20), it takes only adequate photos (my LG takes GREAT pics), the battery runs almost out after only a few hours of little to no usage and with power save on - plus I haven't even talked on this phone yet! (my LG runs hours longer and I occasionally talk on it), and this Alcatel takes HOURS to fully charge (my LG takes an hour at most and that's if it's under 10%). AND while it's charging (power off) it makes a low buzzing sound about every 15 seconds and there is NO way to stop it.In addtion to all that - I cannot open photos on messaging and despite confirming that all the settings are correct. I tried everything possible and then called Alcatel and was actually told that the messaging that is built into this phone is not the best and you can't receive MMS! What? My LG has always opened photos via its built-in messaging, as long as mobile data is enabled. So the Alcatel rep told me to use another messaging app in order to open photos. Unacceptable.And not only all that, it will NOT sound a notification upon receipt of text messages. Again, I have worked with all the appropriate settings (I'm not a novice) over and over and it simply will not work.Also, there are no emojis available on the keypad when you're using Instagram. Huh?I've no doubt there are multiple other problems with this phone that I've never even encountered yet - but in the two weeks that I've used it, these are quite enough problems.And now . . . this is the worst:In the past couple of days, this Alcatel gets VERY HOT during charging (my LG NEVER gets hot when charging, not even in the slightest) - and this heating issue alone is why I am going to send it back because I fear it is potentially dangerous. A phone simply should NOT get this hot while charging.Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own decision - but I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone and I am appalled that this $99 phone (not even worth that) is NOW listed at such a ridiculous price of $240.",negative

"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,"For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too.",negative

I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget.

They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps.

They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps.

Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (White) - AT&T,Apple,"The company gave me a refund without any problems. Exceptional service.The phone is worse than worthless.I used to think apple products were better because I never owned any of them.I wanted to find out if iPhones were really as good as people say they are.I've been a programmer, technician, electronic engineer, satellite communications specialist, phone network specialist, and datacenter network management specialist, before I retired in 2001, and I figured out how to do everything I want with android phones easily when I got my first one in 2010.I couldn't do anything with this.First I had to drive all over the city to find a sim card because it won't even let you use it on wifi without one and it took hours of trying different places because apple changes stuff like that with every new model just so their customers can't keep using their old accessories when they buy a new phone.When I got into it I couldn't get it to do anything.It was perfectly functional but it wouldn't do anything I wanted to do. Even the simplest things I do easily on every windows android or Linux device I've ever used.Of course every Microsoft OS has been extremely badly designed and Android sucks in its own ways, and haven't used Linux enough to have an opinion about it.But ios is the worst I've ever seen.With that and the nonremovable battery which will stop working in about a year and hardly any storage, I wouldn't use this phone they paid me.",negative

Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (White) - AT&T,Apple,"Pros and consI will start with the cons: I forgot that the 3GS did not have siri. That was my fault, and because its an older model. and is on the newest firmware; the battery life is not all that great. 7 hours of use before it dies.Other reviews state that this company is shipping 3G phones instead of 3Gs.At first i thought the same thing until I called my carrear, and gave them the model number. They confirmed it was 3GS.Pros.Item arrived extremly quickly :-)As advertised it was brand new in box un-opened. :-)With moderate use, without the use of GPS, or downloading apps. Canging settings from 3G to 2G noticably increases the battery life.Over all i am extremly happy with my purchase.",negative

I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass!

I always had service with my htc so it is not my service provider. My friend who has the Iphone3 says the same thing.. very annoying.I was spoiled by having a gps tell me when to turn - the iphone 3 comes with a navigation system which is a lifesaver so and so often - but you still have to flip thru the steps manually as you go which can get you a ticket or killed at times.Some of the apps I could get for free for Android I have to pay for now.. bummer.The camera is terrible sadly, no flash, and no front screen camera..However, the phone works, it*s pretty, and if you use your phone mainly for calling and texting and only need the internet at times it works very well. I love the way the voicemails are set up!!!I don*t understand btw why apple makes the front screen from glass!

Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy.

I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s.

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,PRODUCT IS NOT NEW AS STATED. PRODUCT IS REFURBISHED. Don't buy this phone from planet mobile. Mine had all sorts of problems right off the bat but I just dealt with them until after a few months when it completely broke same as another reviewer said where it only stays on for a few minutes and then a yellow or red screen flashes and it restarts. It stays at 1%. They said I couldn't return it because it was past the 90 days but that the manufacture warranty would still be good since all iPhones have a 1 year warranty. Well I checked and it was expired and Apple said the phone was purchased in 2010. I bought it in 2014. That means it is REFURBISHED NOT NEW the description is a lie but Amazon said I wasnt covered by the A to Z coverage because I didn't let them know the product was not as described in the first FOURTEEN days. I had no way of knowing it was refurbished because by all intents and purposes it was a new phone but it lasted just long enough to seem fine until it was too late to return. And I had no idea it was refurbished until I schedule the manufacture warranty as was suggested. I have tried to make continuous claims and they always say they understand but I always get denied thanks to the 14 days period I needed to respond. CHECK YOUR SERIAL NUMBER upon receiving it to see if your warranty is expired. Then you'll know it refurbished. I wish someone had told me that before I wasted my money.,negative

THE WORST PART OF ALL WAS... I wasn't allowed to call people, my phone eventually after four months it stopped letting me call people.

Faulty and Inadequate advertising, in order to sell products. I would never pay full price for a locked phone because I want to avoid the hassle of going through hoops to get it unlocked.

I Ended up using it is assistive mode with a touchscreen floating home button. does the trick, though lets face it its not as it should be, however, the phone was 120$ instead of 500$.

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (Black) - AT&T,Apple,"I was excited to have gotten this phone in spring of 2013. I upgraded from an iPhone 3GS (yes I know I am behind on the times here). The phone carried so much memory and data that I was able to keep up with the new data downloads or whatever you call it. I never once had to erase or delete my apps and camera roll (as what I had to to do with my iPhone 3GS).Let's fast forward...I only used the phone for 11 months. Just right after I upgraded it to the new iOS (Spring 2014), my iPhone 4 acted up badly!! I couldn't get out of an app for how many times I hit the ""home"" button. It drove me crazy. And I couldn't even get into my call screen without having to hit home so many more times. I hated my phone because of the iOS that was downloaded at the time.I parted ways with my iphone4 (it was a sad moment) and left AT&T to be with Verizon.Verizon embraced me and got me the iPhone 5s. Yes it was a huge leap from the early iphone 4 to now an IPhone 5s (yea I felt like I was ballin' like a rockstar....until iphone 6 came out and then I ran out of memory on my 16gb iPhone 5s)....yea just because I left my iPhone 4 32gb for an IPhone 5s 16gb; I sure miss all those extra stored memory of my iphone4.

But what's the point of a phone when a call or text comes in and I have NO idea? Horribly inconvenient. I didn't buy this phone for fun, I need it to COMMUNICATE.

Ordered a Verizon phone and got a Verizon phone. There were a few small scratches on the back of the phone but I put a case on right away. The only thing wrong is there is a small spot on the screen that is more whited out than the rest of the screen. Not big and not a big issue. Ive been using it for a few months now. I have finally activated the phone and had no issues. Only reason for 4 stars is the whiter spot on the screen. Great seller.,negative

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,"We bought 3 phones from Pure Mobility in December for our three kids as Christmas gifts. By March my son's phone was not working right, the on/off switch didn't work. He took it to the local Apple Store to be told that it was a pre-owned phone & had been repaired before, plus, the warranty was no longer valid due to it originally being purchased over a year ago. Now, in May, my daughter's phone does not work AT ALL! This is only 5 months after buying it! She took her phone to the Apple Store & was told the same thing...it was pre-owned AND repaired before we bought it, therefore, they can do nothing about it.We are very unhappy with our purchase and would not advise any one to purchase from Pure Mobility.When we contacted Pure Mobility, they told us that there was nothing they could do about it!! Can you believe that?!We feel that we just threw almost $1,000 in the trash.",negative

Apple iPhone 4 32GB (White) - Verizon,Apple,"As mentioned in numerous other reviews, the trade in service for phones is a scam.

It looked like it had been used, but was in no way, shape or form ""heavily scratched."" Long story short I got $100 less on my trade-in because, as the email stated, it was ""heavily scratched.""

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,"It wasn’t only a refurbished item instead of unused item. The IPhone 4 I received and sent back is a fraud.On october 17, I spent more than 2 hours at the Genius Bar of Apple Store at 5th Avenue, New York. They recommended me to do a back up first and come back the other day.The following day, 18, in Apple Store at 14th Street, New York, I spent another 2 hours at the Genius Bar just to know 1) that they couldn't just replace the phone because it was out of warranty - it expired two years before, one year after it had been bought by its first owner, in June 2010. So if wanted a replacement I'd have to pay US$ 150 for it - which I accepted; and 2) at the very moment of the transaction, the guy who served me at the shop counter noticed something in the iPhone and asked me to wait.

The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised.

Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,The main reason I did not like this product is that from the time it arrived it did not work properly.

When I could finally take it to mu apple dealer he looked up the serial and discovered that it was in reality a used phone purchased over a year before whose warranty was expired. amazon stood by its warranty and refunded me but it was a hassle for me because I live outside the usa and am now trying to get a replacement for my phone.

When I contacted them about the problem and returned it, they said they would 'have their technicians inspect it' before refunding the money. The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars.

The front speaker just went dead 3 days ago, the phone wont ring or produce any sound anymore!!!! Also, there is something wrong with the earphone jack as well, because during song playing we can hear ""pops"" and sudden pauses, just like in vynil players. Moreover, the ""Face Proximity Sensor"" never worked, but I didnt even know it exists, so I could not find out sooner.I took it to an Apple authorized Repair Shop, and to my surprise I was informed that identified that the iPhone was refurbished with a lot of low quality spare parts, including the cameras (back and front ones), and even the front touch screen glass!!I have no doubt that the phone was not ""Very good"" as advertised.

The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars.

Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,"I recently bought an iPhone 4S from this seller. When it arrived it looked fine. We went to Verizon to set it up- and here is where the problem started. The camera light would not turn off, the tech said that's a sign of water damage and it was literally draining the battery at very rapid rate. I booked a Genius Bar appointment at apple to see if it could be fixed. When they opened up the phone they discovered it has been tampered with, voiding the warranty and the light was not repairable.Contacted the seller who sent us another iPhone 4S. POTENTIAL BUYERS READ THIS: given our issue with the last phone we booked another apple store appointment just to have the phone checked out. It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech.

It arrived quickly and the packaging was really smart, a plastic wrapper kept the phone strapped to the bottom of the box so the phone wasn't bouncing around during shipping. The order was fulfilled by Amazon so it had the Prime shipping, and I felt good knowing that I was backed with Amazons return policy should the phone be a dud. I have had no problem with the phone itself, it is in good working condition, clean, and undamaged though I can tell it is a used phone as it has some min or dings on the back glass panel. The phone came in an iPhone 4s box, with a charger, but no ear buds.About the 4s: I bought this phone because my Galaxy S4 had a tragic end and my contract wont give me a new phone for another 7 months. This phone was inexpensive so that's what won out. In general, I don't like the iPhone as much as I like my GS4. Don't quite know what else to say about it.

At least the battery wasn't!Some time later I opened up the included earbuds and plugged them in, only to find out that they are really awful. The sound is bad, and it goes in and out. if you barely touch the cord, the sound glitches, indicating that internal wires may be loose. But they were ""NEW"", remember? Upon further examination, I'm pretty sure that they are knock-off buds, not true Apple buds.If I had purchased a phone that was honestly advertised as used/refurbished, I wouldn't have been as upset by these things.

It's even worse this time around, the apple tech said it had been tampered with and cautioned us to get rid of the phone as soon as possible. When I pushed him for details on what was wrong with the phone, He said the phone had been tampered with to the point that it can be used for IDENTITY THEFT, basically opening any accounts used on the phone and getting account information- he wasn't supposed to tell us this but thank god he did! Almost everyone I know has a banking app or email with very private information.No matter how much it ends up costing you, do not buy from this seller. I'm fairly certain all of the positive reviews are from people who are none the wiser and never had their phones inspected by an apple tech. Remember that it takes over a year to get your identity back if its stolen, not worth it for a used iPhone.",negative

A Verizon Wireless rep suggested that used phones purchased through one of Amazon's used item stores where probably a safe bet. Referencing an email from Amazon based on my past searches, I looked at the phones sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals.This was a used phone, packed in the original Apple sealed packaging. No problems, cosmetic or otherwise. Phone was easily set up and activated without any assistance from Verizon Wireless service reps.When activating your phone to replace the dead phone, be sure to use the ""Reset to Factory Settings"" option under settings which essentially makes your used iPhone a ""new"" phone. I also found my current iCloud backup on the phone and restored that so that my apps and contacts would be current.Dialing *228 from the new phone will contact Verizon Wireless and activate the replacement iPhone. You will be prompted for the number of the phone you are replacing and the last four digits of your Social Security number to verify you are the legit owner of the account (you were asked for this info when the account was created). In a few seconds, your new phone will be activated and ready to use.There is no need to follow the documented iTunes activation procedures to get the replacement phone online.Regardless of what other articles say, there was no need to know the ESN (MEID) of the old or new phones or remove the battery to find this info (note that a charged iPhone displays its MEID under settings).",negative
Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (Black) Unlocked - Verizon,Apple,"The seller did a really good job on shipping quickly. I received the phone before the estimated due date which was great. What wasn't so great was the condition of the phone. It wasn't like new at all. The bottom part where the charging port is was all dented. There were also markings on the top part of the phone where the power button is situated. Amazon's description of Used - Like New: An apparently untouched item in perfect condition. Original protective wrapping may be missing, but the original packaging is intact and pristine. There are absolutely no signs of wear on the item or its packaging. Instructions are included. Item is suitable for presenting as a gift.There were no instructions and no box. The phone had been put in bubblewrap and shoved in a postage box with the accessories. Additionally, the ""free accessories"" that were provided had seen better days. The otterbox case was supposed to be white but it was so dirty and scratched it couldn't have been used.Now this may seem like I'm nit-picking but I really am not. I expected a like new phone and didn't get one. When you fork out $349 and it doesn't meet your expectations, it's very disappointing. Not to mention the fact it's a lot of money.Overall the seller was understanding, although he stood by his description and said the condition is subjective and down to the end users interpretation. Misleading in my book. So the phone was returned and I did get a full refund - thankfully.",negative
Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (Black) Unlocked - Verizon,Apple,This was not new. The bottom screws came right out.

Apple iPhone 5 16GB Verizon Wireless CDMA 4G LTE Cell Phone - White,Apple,"The phone works great, the price was good, and it arrived sooner than expected. I'm thoroughly satisfied. The only downside is that whoever owned the phone before would always start to charge it when it hit 20%.

So, whenever the battery hits 20% it's just a matter of minutes (sometimes seconds) before it dies. But, if that's the worst thing out of a used phone, I consider myself lucky.",negative

Apple iPhone 5 32GB (White) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,"The button at the bottom of the screen rotates constantly, probably from some DIY person taking it apart to change the battery and breaking it. With the battery supposedly being brand new it doesn't hold a charge very well, or very long. The motion detector chip is also broken (probably also a result of the DIY battery change), so the health app doesn't work because it doesn't detect movement. The earpiece is quieter and more muffled than my previous phone, which is another downside. Whether or not that is yet another result of the battery change or simply a factory defect, I don't know. I rate it as 3-stars (meaning ""it's okay"") because I did buy it used and suspect I can't expect high quality. It's ""okay"" simply because it does work, meaning it gets signal, it allows me to make phone calls, and my apps (with the exception of the health app) work.",negative

I'm not a person who uses voice control or Siri, so I would disable these both if that were an option. I have Siri off. If I have it on then it takes over my phone instead of VC.

"Apple iPhone 5 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, White",Apple,"I've bought two iPhone 5 from this merchant, one in June and another in November 2015. Overall the phones are functional, but I've discovered refurbishment flaws that lead to my low overall rating. Soon after my wife started using her phone, she noticed that her battery charge was erratic (dropping from 60% to 10% to in a matter of minutes) and didn't last very long overall. After a few more months, we installed the app ""Battery Life"" (which I highly recommend) and we quickly figured out that her battery already had 700+ cycles and was in ""Very Bad: 41% battery life level"" condition. I contacted Resell Cell for assistance, and they responded ""Im not sure how you would like for my company to test the battery life of a phone. there is no such way, we get our phones to 100% full, leave them on for 20 min and see what their % is."" Well actually there is a quick, easy and accurate way to check battery life and that is with the app ""Battery Life."" Resell Cell told me ""We do not offer any warranties on phones after 8 months. However, at a local repair shop, a battery change should not cost you more than $10-20."" so I bought a Scanditech replacement battery (also highly recommended) on Amazon and changed the battery myself. While replacing the battery I discovered that the two screws at the bottom of the phone (near the speakers) were missing and inside the phone the protective cover plate for the LCD connectors was also missing. As best as I can tell, when Resell Cell refurbished the phone, they neglected to reinstall the cover plate and bottom screws. When I informed Resell Cell of what I perceived as a poor refurb, they replied ""you threatening me with negative reviews is taken very serious."" Sigh. At the end of the day, and after I replaced a battery at my own expense, both phones work pretty well, but Resell Cell seems to me to do some sloppy refurbs and have paranoid and unfriendly customer service.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5 Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, White",Apple,"I've bought two iPhone 5 from this merchant, one in June and another in November 2015. Overall the phones are functional, but I've discovered refurbishment flaws that lead to my low overall rating. Soon after my wife started using her phone, she noticed that her battery charge was erratic (dropping from 60% to 10% to in a matter of minutes) and didn't last very long overall. After a few more months, we installed the app ""Battery Life"" (which I highly recommend) and we quickly figured out that her battery already had 700+ cycles and was in ""Very Bad: 41% battery life level"" condition. I contacted Resell Cell for assistance, and they responded ""Im not sure how you would like for my company to test the battery life of a phone. there is no such way, we get our phones to 100% full, leave them on for 20 min and see what their % is."" Well actually there is a quick, easy and accurate way to check battery life and that is with the app ""Battery Life."" Resell Cell told me ""We do not offer any warranties on phones after 8 months. However, at a local repair shop, a battery change should not cost you more than $10-20."" so I bought a Scanditech replacement battery (also highly recommended) on Amazon and changed the battery myself. While replacing the battery I discovered that the two screws at the bottom of the phone (near the speakers) were missing and inside the phone the protective cover plate for the LCD connectors was also missing. As best as I can tell, when Resell Cell refurbished the phone, they neglected to reinstall the cover plate and bottom screws. When I informed Resell Cell of what I perceived as a poor refurb, they replied ""you threatening me with negative reviews is taken very serious."" Sigh. At the end of the day, and after I replaced a battery at my own expense, both phones work pretty well, but Resell Cell seems to me to do some sloppy refurbs and have paranoid and unfriendly customer service.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, White",Apple,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!! He sold this phone ILLEGALLY. For several weeks, I had experienced consistent poor to absent cell phone signal, a dull screen that failed to reach max brightness, and a short, low battery life. I went to the Apple store to troubleshoot if it's bad luck/spotty areas, or if the antenna was damaged internally. I came to find the phone was non-serviceable, meaning it was a defective phone to begin with, exchanged prior to being given to me, was supposed to be returned to the Apple store, and not in another person's possession but resold. After filing a claim through apple, they could not even track the phone's original serial number as it had been resold multiple times. When I asked this seller for a refund/return, he refused because it was beyond his 30-day refund policy. (the phone was bearable for the first 30 days)Do not be fooled by this scam artist, or other scam artists out there who resell defective electronics.

After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund..

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Green) - AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone.

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Green) - AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Do not buy from this seller unless you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund.. So glad I missed all those calls, not like I was trying to find a job or anything! Seriously one of the worst experiences I have had on Amazon. Avoid wasting your time and money.",negative

I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,"I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don't either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality.",negative

It was once Apple started to replace the screen that it was found to be a phone that was NOT original as sold to us. It had a third party screen that they were not able to replace.

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (White) - Sprint,Apple,"Where to start...Well this was a very frustrating experience to say the very least! The phone I revived was neither Sprint, or refurbished. Do not buy from this seller unless you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card...

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Yellow) - AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 16GB (Yellow) - AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone.

Now, I am back to using an older phone and I have no idea what to do with the phone I purchased. I have never owned an iPhone with so many issues. The earphones fell apart within a couple of days.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Blue) - AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

It was once Apple started to replace the screen that it was found to be a phone that was NOT original as sold to us. It had a third party screen that they were not able to replace.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Blue) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.",negative

Do not buy from this seller unless you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund..

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Green) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,"I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don't either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality.",negative

The phone has had multiple resets and still refuses to text some numbers. Everything else works fine on the phone and can be used as a phone but not to text some of my contacts.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Pink) - AT&T,Apple,Bought this phone to replace an iphone4 on our AT&T work account. Buying the phone outright beats paying the monthly upgrade fees from AT&T over time.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Pink) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.",negative

Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (White) - AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (White) - AT&T,Apple,Bought this phone to replace an iphone4 on our AT&T work account. Buying the phone outright beats paying the monthly upgrade fees from AT&T over time.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (White) - AT&T,Apple,"I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don't either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (White) - AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer. However, for $65 (plus tax) spent on a new battery, the phone now works well. I certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (White) - Sprint,Apple,"Where to start...Well this was a very frustrating experience to say the very least! The phone I revived was neither Sprint, or refurbished. Do not buy from this seller unless you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund.. So glad I missed all those calls, not like I was trying to find a job or anything! Seriously one of the worst experiences I have had on Amazon. Avoid wasting your time and money.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (White) - Sprint,Apple,"Where to start...Well this was a very frustrating experience to say the very least! The phone I revived was neither Sprint, or refurbished. Do not buy from this seller unless you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund.. So glad I missed all those calls, not like I was trying to find a job or anything! Seriously one of the worst experiences I have had on Amazon. Avoid wasting your time and money.",negative

It was once Apple started to replace the screen that it was found to be a phone that was NOT original as sold to us. It had a third party screen that they were not able to replace.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer. However, for $65 (plus tax) spent on a new battery, the phone now works well. I certainly would not buy from this dishonest provider again.",negative

The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone.

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - Sprint,Apple,"Where to start...Well this was a very frustrating experience to say the very least! The phone I revived was neither Sprint, or refurbished. Do not buy from this seller unless you throughly enjoy being dicked around and having your time wasted.From the start I was upset a faster shipping method was not available. After waiting a week for the phone I revived a phone just about as broken as the one I was replacing. There were huge starches all over the screen... Deep ones I am not sure how the screen was still intact! There was actual gouges missing out of the plastic sides. It heated up while attempting to charge, the 3 hours it was on the charger before it would turn on! Then I finally got the hunk of 185$ crap on.. I re program it 3x and keep getting a message about the SIM card do I look up how to switch that out as it didn't come with a sprint or any other SIM card... Then I get a message that the phone is locked. So I spend an hour on the phone with sprint.. turns out this ugly paper weight is not even a sprint phone. So 2 more weeks I get a refund.. So glad I missed all those calls, not like I was trying to find a job or anything! Seriously one of the worst experiences I have had on Amazon. Avoid wasting your time and money.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c 32GB (Yellow) - Verizon Wireless,Apple,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget.

Apple iPhone 5c a1532 8GB Blue Smartphone for AT&T,Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

Apple iPhone 5c a1532 8GB Blue Smartphone for AT&T,Apple,"I believe I was purchasing a new - not refurbhished item. However, the phone has been problematic since it was activated. After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone.

Apple Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - Blue,Apple,"Update: I am not blaming the vendor, but I did purchase an internally damaged phone from Cellular Trendz.Over a year ago I bought a white iPhone 5c on here from ""WeSellCellular"" and the phone was great and at a great price. I needed another cheap 5c so I got a green one from Cellular Trendz. Everything was fine except the battery life lasted a few hours even without me touching the phone. I am tech savvy and I've done numerous iPhone repairs myself so I bought a reputable battery here on Amazon. I opened the phone and I noticed one of the water damage indicators was red. Red= water damaged, white = never been exposed to water. I checked the other internal water damage indicator and it was also red. One of the screws that holds the battery connector in place was missing, but, it gets worse. There are RICE GRAINS inside the phone!! Not one or two random unidentifiable crumbs but multiple rice grains lodged in crevices of the phone. This leads me to believe someone water damaged the phone, removed the battery, and stuck it in rice.Good for a backup phone or someone who really wants an iPhone while on a budget. However, with the latest iOS 9 update this phone is slower than ever! Try and get one with iOS 8.4 or prior, but for long-term use I would go for a newer model.",negative

Since I knew the people well at my local Verizon store, I finally convinced them to insure it. But now it won't hold the iCloud password: it is either an internal phone problem or an Apple problem.

After a few months of use, it began to power itself down automatically after 5 to 20 minutes of use. It also didn't hold a charge for very long. I took it to a recommended repair shop and the technician suggested that the battery could be bad. Upon opening the phone to change the battery, he discovered a somewhat bloated battery - indicating that it had probably been wet at one time. (I can attest that the phone has never been dunked!) He also said that ""stickers"" inside the case indicate that the phone was a refurbished one. I had never had it serviced before and as said, I thought I was buying a new phone. When I ordered, there was no indication to say it was not anything but new. Upon notifying the seller that I received a used/refurbished rather than a new phone, I received a canned reply that basically said I had 30 days from purchase to return the phone - a totally unsatisfactory answer.

Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"This cell phone had a total system failure after only 9 months. The cost to have it repaired is almost equal to the purchase price. But after taking the Iphone to the local Apple store who tried to identify the problem, we learned there is not an option for Apple to repair the phone. It turns out the phone was previously damaged & repaired by a non-Apple repair center using non-Apple approved parts. So we quickly learned all Apple warranties are voided & they will not even attempt to repair the modified phone for any price.",negative

I was skeptical after reading some reviews, but the refurbished phone works great! No visible damages, either. The only problem is that it didn't come with a sim card. I called my carrier to have one shipped, but they needed some number that was not included with the phone so I had to go into the local store to have a sim card installed.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"I had recently lost my old iPhone 5c and was in desperate need for a new phone. I just recieved a used iphone 5c 32gb from Dutchmoney10. Although it did come in ahead of time i am not happy with the condition and further problems that came with this iPhone. The seller neglected to notify that the phone did not come with an ""active"" sim card which was told to me while i was attempting to set up the new phone through at&t at my house. Now i will have to pay an extra 36 dollars to purchase and activate the new sim card. I don't understand why they would deactivate the previous sim card so that it is completely useless and basically trash and then proceed to not notify me and to make it my problem to dispose of. The product description listed that the phone had a few minor blemishes and scratches on the back but come to find out all four corners are chipped and the back side is is torn up like it was thrown across pavement. also the on/off button is loose and is difficult to press. I am not happy with this seller and the only reason that i will keep this phone is because i am in such dear need for a phone. I will never buy a used phone again and especially not from Dutchmoney10 and i suggest you don't either its deffinitely worth it to splurge a little for something with better quality.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money.

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"Just got my IPhone 5C. Got it in 4 days. No problem. Everything worked out great. Would have been nice if the price was cheaper. But My recommendation is to spend that extra money and get a new one, I don't trust the old ones.The only con with this purchase was the headphones are crap and knock off. Didn't even work properly. The phone charger/adapter also is not apple. But I already have plenty of those so it didn't matter. That is the only reason why I didn't given 5/5 stars. Overall very satisfied",negative
"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"After using this phone for approximately 2 months, the screen started being distorted and wouldn't work properly. Once we were able to get to an Apple Store for repair, they informed us that the issue was the screen and that a new screen would need to be installed. It was once Apple started to replace the screen that it was found to be a phone that was NOT original as sold to us. It had a third party screen that they were not able to replace. We were frauded by this company as they did not sell us an original phone and we are out over $300 on a defective phone!",negative

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,negative
"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,negative
"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,negative
"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"I've been using this phone for about a month and it's working great for a refurbished iPhone 5c! There is a small, minor scratch on the screen that isn't noticeable when the screen is on, and a small portion of the apple logo is scratched off of the back. But I can't complain because they do warn that there will be minor damage on the exterior of the phone. It came with the charger. I wanted there to be headphones too, but that's just wishful thinking.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"Admittedly, I was a rank amateur, but with a PhD in computer science, at researching iPhones and I was in a hurry, I had used Unlocked as my primary search key, and then honed the search down to this phone that included as the third point in the product listing, to the side of the maiin picture, a discussion of how unlocked phones were useful, blah, blah, blahSo I hit buy it now, and rush it to me, as I was preparing to leave for Europe. Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",negative

They told us that the blue casing is not apple, and that the screen all the way to the inner workings were not apple and that they would not touch it for repair etc. It appears this is a knock off. It is working so far but for how long. This seller advertised this as a new Apple phone- Buyer beware.",negative

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,"All I have to say is that they do not tell you enough about their products.

However, the phone is somewhat unusable as there are some technical problems. I have done everything that i can to get the phone to work as it should (gone to AT&T, contacted Apple, and researched solutions on the net). The phone has had multiple resets and still refuses to text some numbers. Everything else works fine on the phone and can be used as a phone but not to text some of my contacts.

"Apple iPhone 5c AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, White",Apple,Bought this phone to replace an iphone4 on our AT&T work account. Buying the phone outright beats paying the monthly upgrade fees from AT&T over time. Took the phones in to the local AT&T store and they activated them with no problem. They did not come with sim cards but AT&T did not charge us to put one in. Don't love the blue color but they are covered up with a case anyway:),negative
