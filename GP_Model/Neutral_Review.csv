No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations. If you buy the right case no one will ever even know that it's the cheapest phone Apple makes, but I guarantee you that in very short order you will say to yourself ""I should have got the 16BG one"".",neutral

No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations. If you buy the right case no one will ever even know that it's the cheapest phone Apple makes, but I guarantee you that in very short order you will say to yourself ""I should have got the 16BG one"".",neutral

No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations.

No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations. If you buy the right case no one will ever even know that it's the cheapest phone Apple makes, but I guarantee you that in very short order you will say to yourself ""I should have got the 16BG one"".",neutral

No problems there.The bad:8GB is straight up not enough memory for an iPhone these days. Photos take up a lot of space as do text messages and emails (you won't really be able to use it as an iPod). By the time the iOS is installed you're down to 5-6GB then things start getting cramped. Seriously, if you have an iPhone go to Settings-General-Usage-Manage Storage and see how large these apps are. Pandora alone is like 150kb. So after deleting a bunch of unused stuff I have 800kb left. That's really not even enough to update the iOS when they release a new one, so I will have to hook this thing to my laptop when that day comes (yes I'm writing this review in it, so it obviously works).In short: but it if you can live with the limitations. If you buy the right case no one will ever even know that it's the cheapest phone Apple makes, but I guarantee you that in very short order you will say to yourself ""I should have got the 16BG one"".",neutral
